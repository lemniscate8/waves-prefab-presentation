Outline

So you've just written a super cool command-line tool.
It runs the simulation your research is based on.
You've just sent a link to your collaborator, but they can't figure out how to get the same results as you...
...well actually they can't get the tool to run
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Let's see how Empirical can help!

We're going to turn this project into a web application!
Let's start with changes to our C++ code.

First, we'll create a document object.
This is where all our components will live.

I'd like a way to run code from my application.
- Show adding a button


Let's confirm this is actually doing something.
- Note that cout has been redirected to console
- Demo live variables and button to refresh them.

But if you've got one thing to show, you probably have a lot more...
and we have a solution for that.
- Unveil the readout panel
This is only the bare bones right now.
A lot more cool visualization tools exist or are on their way.

Next, we can make this simulation even better by controlling parameters!
- Highlight diagonal
Would be nice to control this inside the app.

If you're using Empirical's configuration system
- Show code
it's simple to add a config panel!

The config panel even comes with an easy restart button.


? Mention the control panel ?
For other simulations we've got a nice start stop button to control it.

If you're just starting out, we've actually got a way to build templates
